As a Filipina American woman in science and tech, I'm passionate about
educational outreach and diversity and inclusion efforts in pursuit of equity
in STEM fields.
If you are looking for partners / co-presenters for conferences, panels, or workshops
on those topics, I am happy to share experiences and contribute to and collaborate
on projects of mutual interest.

Below are some efforts I've been involved with and info on how you can support.

## Diversity in STEM

### Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy
I've served on the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Committee on the Status
of Women in Astronomy [(CSWA)](https://aas.org/comms/cswa) since June 2017.
Our charge is to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees for
"practical measures that the AAS can take to improve the status of women in
astronomy and encourage their entry into this field."

We recently published two Astro2020 Decadal Survey "APC" (Activities, Projects,
and State of the Profession Considerations) [white papers](/astro2020-white-papers/),
calling on federal science funding agencies to action.

* ["CSWA: Towards Eliminating Harassment in Astronomy"](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51g.169Z/abstract){:target="_blank"}

### AASWomen Newsletter
I'm an editor for the AASWomen weekly newsletter, which collects and distributes
articles relevant to women and minorities in astronomy and other scientific fields
as well as job postings of interest to the community

The newsletter and job postings are also posted to the
[Women in Astronomy blog](http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/){:target="_blank"}.

If you would like to contribute, subscribe, or post a job to the email listhost, find more
information [here](https://aas.org/comms/cswa/AASWOMEN){:target="_blank"}.

### PyLadies
[PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/){:target="_blank"} is an "international mentorship group which
focuses on helping more women become active participants in the Python open-source community."

In my previous Seattle-based life, I helped organize monthly Technical Talk Nights
for PyLadies Seattle, which is a particularly awesome meetup group.
You can learn about the Seattle meetup group
[here](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-PyLadies/){:target="_blank"}.

If you are Seattle based, the group can always use meetup venue space or volunteers
for talks.

## Outreach and Mentoring

### Built By Girls
I'm an advisor for the WAVE BuiltByGirls program, which aims to provide mentorship
for young women interested in careers in the tech industry.  

You can learn more and sign up to be an advisor or advisee

### The Children's Museum of Indianapolis
Every other Sunday you might find me on the
