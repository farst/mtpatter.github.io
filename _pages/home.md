I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [High Alpha Innovation](https://www.highalphainno.com/){:target="_blank"},
where I help with data and analytic strategies for corporate innovation through startup creation.  I also design data products, architect cloud-based data science and analysis pipelines, and develop machine learning models for startups in the [High Alpha](https://www.highalpha.com/){:target="_blank"} portfolio.  I've worked on projects with [Pattern89](https://www.pattern89.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Zylo](https://zylo.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Structural](https://www.structural.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Docket](https://www.dockethq.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Canopy](https://canopy.io/){:target="_blank"}, and [Cured](https://www.cured.health/){:target="_blank"}.

After earning my PhD in astronomy, I spent several years at the University of Chicago's Center for Data Intensive Science and Laboratory for Advanced Computing, working as Director of the Open Science Data Cloud, the (now retired) first generation of ["data commons"](/new-paper-data-commons/) projects developed by the Open Commons Consortium [(OCC)](http://occ-data.org){:target="_blank"}. Our team worked with NASA on OCC Project Matsu to archive, publicly distribute, and build automated analysis pipelines for daily satellite imagery. I also worked with the Presidential Innovation Fellows team and the OCC as Technical Lead on the first stage of the [NOAA Big Data Project](https://www.noaa.gov/big-data-project){:target="_blank"}. We prototyped a data platform with a digital ID service so that scientists can access climate and weather data agnostic to its physical location and across cloud platforms.

I then returned to astronomy as a Research Scientist at the University of Washington's [Dept of Astronomy](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/){:target="_blank"} as part of the Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology [(DIRAC)](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu){:target="_blank"} Institute working in the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time [(LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/about/dm){:target="_blank"} Data Management Science Pipelines group. Our team designed and built the Zwicky Transient Facility [(ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/){:target="_blank"} Survey's alert stream distribution system [(ZADS)](/new-paper-zads/), which detects and distributes data from about a million changing objects (supernova, variable stars, asteroids, etc.) each night and is planned to be used by the LSST at 10x scale. And yes, that's a lot of acronyms, I know.

I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, effective science communication, and diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. I'm listed as a resource in the 500 women scientists' [request-a-woman-scientist](https://request500womenscientists.org/profile/8442){:target="_blank"} database, if you are looking for someone with my background for panels, conferences, or interviews.

In general, I am interested in new data science tools and techniques and ways I can contribute to data-intensive projects in high-impact applications. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me out for a long run, on my porch making my own [whittle friends](https://whittlefriends.com), or at a baseball game.  Go Cubs!
