I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer on the Data Science team at [High Alpha](https://highalpha.com).  I help startups develop their data science pipelines.  I primarily hang out with [Pattern89](https://www.pattern89.com/), [Zylo](https://zylo.com/), [Structural](https://www.structural.com/), and [Loupe](https://loupe.co/).

After earning my PhD in astronomy, I spent several years at the University of Chicago's Center for Data Intensive Science in the Laboratory for Advanced Computing and worked on several scientific data commons projects with the [Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org). I worked with NASA on OCC Project Matsu to archive, publicly distribute, and build automated analysis pipelines for daily satellite imagery from the Earth Observing-1 mission. I also worked with the [Open Commons Consortium (OCC)](http://occ-data.org) as a technical lead on the [NOAA Big Data Project](https://data-alliance.noaa.gov), prototyping a data digital identifier service to access NEXRAD data independent of its physical location and across cloud platforms.

I then returned to astronomy as a Research Scientist at the [University of Washington's Department of Astronomy](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/) as part of the [Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology (DIRAC) Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu) working in the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Data Management](https://www.lsst.org/about/dm) Science Pipelines group. I prototyped the LSST's alert stream distribution system, which was put into production for the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) Survey.

I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, and effective science communication.

In general, I am interested in learning new data analysis tools and applying my analytic background to data-intensive research in any high-impact field awaiting new discoveries. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me [out for a long run](https://twitter.com/runaverage).
