I am currently a Research Scientist at the [University of Washington's Department of Astronomy](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/) working in the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Data Management](http://dm.lsst.org) Science Pipelines group. The UW group is developing the alert production pipeline, building algorithms and tools for the automated detection of astronomical transient phenomena and subsequent alert distribution to enable fast follow-up observations.

<br> After earning my PhD in astronomy, I spent several years at the University of Chicago's Center for Data Intensive Science in the Laboratory for Advanced Computing and worked on several scientific data commons projects with the [Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org). I worked with NASA on [OCC Project Matsu](https://matsu.opensciencedatacloud.org) to archive, publicly distribute, and build automated analysis pipelines for daily satellite imagery from the Earth Observing-1 mission. I also worked with the [Open Commons Consortium (OCC)](http://occ-data.org) as a technical lead on the [NOAA Big Data Project](https://data-alliance.noaa.gov), prototyping a data digital identifier service to access NEXRAD data independent of its physical location and across cloud platforms.

<br> I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, and effective science communication.

<br> In general, I am interested in learning new data analysis tools and applying my analytic background to data-intensive research in any high-impact field awaiting new discoveries. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me [out for a long run](http://runningaverage.com).
