I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer on the Data Science team at [High Alpha](https://highalpha.com).  I help startups develop their data science pipelines.  I primarily hang out with [Pattern89](https://www.pattern89.com/), [Zylo](https://zylo.com/), [Structural](https://www.structural.com/), and [Loupe](https://loupe.co/).

After earning my PhD in astronomy, I spent several years at the University of Chicago's Center for Data Intensive Science and Laboratory for Advanced Computing working on several scientific data commons projects with the [Open Science Data Cloud](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org). I worked with NASA on OCC Project Matsu to archive, publicly distribute, and build automated analysis pipelines for daily satellite imagery from the Earth Observing-1 mission. I also worked with the [Open Commons Consortium (OCC)](http://occ-data.org) as a technical lead on the [NOAA Big Data Project](https://data-alliance.noaa.gov), prototyping a data digital identifier service to access NEXRAD data independent of its physical location and across cloud platforms.

I then returned to astronomy as a Research Scientist at the [University of Washington's Department of Astronomy](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/) as part of the [Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology (DIRAC) Institute](https://dirac.astro.washington.edu) working in the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Data Management](https://www.lsst.org/about/dm) Science Pipelines group. I prototyped the LSST's alert stream distribution system, which was put into production for the [Zwicky Transient Facility](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) Survey.

I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, effective science communication, and diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. You can tap me as a resource in the 500 women scientists' [request-a-woman-scientist](https://500womenscientists.org/request-a-scientist) database.

In general, I am interested in new data science tools and techniques and ways I can contribute to data-intensive research in any high-impact field awaiting new discoveries. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me out for a long run or at a baseball game.  Go Cubs!
