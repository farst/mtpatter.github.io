I contributed to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Center for Open Data Enterprise's [2016 Open Data Roundtable](https://www.data.gov/meta/open-data-roundtables/) on Public-Private Collaboration, representing the academic and not-for-profit research perspective on how we can collaborate to support open data.

With several other organizations and companies working with big datasets, we worked on lessons learned and best practices for developing support for open data in a way that is beneficial to all stakeholders.
From our data commons experiences, we advocated to make open data more discoverable and accessible with API-based services on top of interoperable "data commons" and for the need for support so that scientists/researchers and those familiar with the datasets can validate quality and also help develop tutorials/apps in data commons around clear use cases so that others can build a community around a good foundation of work.
