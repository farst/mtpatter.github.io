PepsiCo and 21st Century Fox named me a modern 'Hidden Figure' in their search to find the next generation of women who will lead the way in STEM.

The announcement page with all the winners and their videos about STEM is here: [Search for Hidden Figures](http://searchforhiddenfigures.com/the-search-for-hidden-figures/).

A kind write-up by the LSST Project office is here: [A Prize Winning Search for Hidden Figures in STEM](https://project.lsst.org/prize-winning-search-hidden-figures-stem).

I programmed my video primarily in Python with open source tools. Watch it below.

I've made the code I used for the video clips available on Github, so that anyone can take what I've made as a starting point and make something much cooler: [Hidden Figures video code](https://github.com/mtpatter/hidden-figures-video).
