I gave a demo for the [Seattle celebration of Open Data Day](https://www.meetup.com/openseattle/events/248143078/) 
put on by Open Seattle and Seattle PyLadies.  The demo is an
example analysis of wages data pulled from the Seattle open
data platform.  Find my demo notebook on Azure notebooks, here:
