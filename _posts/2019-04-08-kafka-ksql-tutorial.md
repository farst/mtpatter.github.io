I wrote a fully-reproducible, Dockerized, step-by-step tutorial
on how to pipe data from Postgres into KSQL for running continuous streaming
queries and sink results back to Postgres.

It's available on High Alpha's medium blog here:
[Data stream processing for newbies with Kafka, KSQL, and Postgres](https://medium.com/high-alpha/data-stream-processing-for-newbies-with-kafka-ksql-and-postgres-c30309cfaaf8).

All the code I wrote is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/mtpatter/postgres-kafka-demo).
