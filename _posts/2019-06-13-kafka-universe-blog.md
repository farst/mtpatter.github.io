I wrote a post on [Confluent's blog](https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-data-from-the-universe-with-apache-kafka/) about how astronomers deploy real-time pipelines
to distribute data from the millions of objects discovered each night by modern telescopes.

It's also available on High Alpha's medium blog here:
[Streaming Data from the Universe with Apache Kafka](https://medium.com/high-alpha/streaming-data-from-the-universe-with-apache-kafka-3b6b54dee6a9).
