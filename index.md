# About Me

I am a research scientist (Astronomy PhD) at the [Laboratory for Advanced Computing](http://labcomputing.opensciencedatacloud.org/) in the [Center for Data Intensive Science](http://cdis.uchicago.edu/) at the 
University of Chicago. I am the scientific lead for the [Open Science Data Cloud](http://opensciencedatacloud.org), which is a resource operated by UChicago and managed by the [Open Cloud Consortium](http://opencloudconsortium.org) that provides the scientific community with a public data commons and compute and storage resources for storing, sharing, and analyzing terabyte and petabyte-scale datasets.   

<br>
I am also a lead for Project Matsu, a project between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Open Cloud Consortium focused on developing cloud-based applications for the automatic processing and analysis of NASA satellite imagery. Matsu is responsible for tools such as the Namibia Early Warning Flood Dashboard, which uses ground and satellite measurements to monitor the risk of flood and subsequent water-borne illness in southern Africa.

<br>
Currently, I am doing research to investigate possible geospatial patterns in the incidence rates of different diseases across the United States.  I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, and effective science communication.

<br>
In general, I am interested in learning new data analysis tools and applying my analytic background to data-intensive research in any high-impact field awaiting new discoveries.
