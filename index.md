# About Me

I am a postdoctoral research scientist (Astronomy PhD) at the [Laboratory for Advanced Computing](http://labcomputing.opensciencedatacloud.org/) in the Center for Data Intensive Science at the 
University of Chicago. I am also a lead for the [Open Science Data Cloud](http://opensciencedatacloud.org). 
Currently, I am researching possible environmental effects on the incidence rates of different diseases across the United States.

<br>
I am also a part of Project Matsu, developing cloud-based applications for the automatic processing and analysis of NASA satellite imagery. Matsu is responsible for tools such as the Namibia Early Warning Flood Dashboard, which uses ground and satellite measurements to monitor the risk of flood and subsequent water-borne illness in southern Africa.

<br>
In general, I am interested in learning new data analysis tools and applying my analytic background to data-intensive research in any high-impact field awaiting new discoveries.
