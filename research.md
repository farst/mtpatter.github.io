I have a strong interest in cross-disciplinary scientific data analysis, techniques and tools for ensuring reproducibility in research in the era of increasingly growing datasets, and effective science communication.
My current research focuses on geospatial disease incidence and the automated analysis of Earth satellite imagery.    

<br>My previous PhD research focused on 
galaxy evolution and formation through studies of faint emission of gas and stars
in galaxy outskirts.  My dissertation was concerned with star formation in galaxy
outer disks and the role of accretion of gas and faint companions in galaxy evolution.  

### Environmental Epidemiology

I am using electronic medical records (EMR) data across the United States to 
look for geospatial patterns and possible environmental factors influencing the incidence of disease and disease pairs.

### Earth Sciences

I work with Project Matsu, a collaboration between NASA and the Open Commons Consortium,
developing cloud-based applications for the analysis of Earth satellite imagery.
I am currently working on a Hadoop-based framework to automatically process daily
satellite images from NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite.

### Astronomy

I am less of an astronomer and more of a data scientist these days.  
My astronomy research focused on deep observations of nearby galaxies, as described below. 
Here is my [SAO/NASA ADS publications query](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?library&libname=my+publications&libid=4f29dfc54b) and my [Google scholar profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x1kZj8MAAAAJ&hl=en).

#### - Star formation in galaxy outskirts
 
The outer disk spiral arms of M81, caused by the interaction with neighboring galaxies M82 and NGC3077, are fertile grounds for exploring star formation in low density environments. The area is characterized by extended cold neutral hydrogen gas (HI) arms and filaments within which are found star forming regions (HII regions of ionized hydrogen) and dwarf galaxies. I analyzed the HII region population over a 1.5 degree field, derived from a Burrell Schmidt H-alpha (ionized hydrogen line) composite supplemented with ARC 3.5-m telescope emission line images of both inner and outer disk HII regions. I focused on studying the luminosities and morphologies of the HII regions and comparing the current massive star formation with the recent and past rates inferred from the stellar populations detected in the outer disk features. I also analyzed abundances for these star forming regions to help determine the origin of outer disk gas. Here you can find a link to my paper, finding a [shallow metallicity gradient for the HII regions of M81 indicating that the outer disk is composed of relatively processed and metal rich gas](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422..401P).

#### - Gas accretion

I am a member of the [HALOGAS](http://www.astron.nl/halogas/) collaboration. The Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) survey aims to investigate cold gas accretion in a sample of 22 neutrally-selected nearby spiral galaxies with 120 hours of integrated observation time at 21 cm for each target. The data are sensitive enough to study faint neutral hydrogen in the galaxy outskirts and to search for halogas and for possible accreting gas clouds. I worked on modeling the HI (cold hydrogen) for a few of these galaxies and studied the correlation between features in the HI gas and features detected in GALEX UV and H-alpha star formation tracers.

#### - Faint stellar streams and low surface brightness features around galaxies
Deep and widefield optical imaging is essential to understand the role of accretion and the source of accreting gas and new material in galaxies. I was the PI for an observing campaign to image the HALOGAS Survey sample of galaxies in broadband and emission line filters with the Kitt Peak National Observatory's 4-meter telescope, in order to search for faint companions and stellar stream features around the galaxies. We compared these images with our very deep HI data to better understand the process of galaxy growth.
My observations are deep enough to successfully recover faint star formation and old stellar streams in several galaxies, including, for example [NGC 4414](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...566A..80D) (which has a huge, beautiful faint shell!), [NGC 3198](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...554A.125G), and [NGC 5023](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434.2069K).
