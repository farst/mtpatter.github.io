My current research focuses on the automated analysis of Earth satellite imagery
and on geospatial studies of disease incidence.  

<br>My PhD research focused on 
galaxy evolution and formation through studies of faint emision of gas and stars
in galaxy outskirts.  My dissertation was concerned with star formation in galaxy
outer disks and the role of accretion of gas and faint companions in galaxy evolution.  

### Environmental Epidemiology

I am using electronic medical records (EMR) data across the United States to 
look for geospatial patterns in the comorbidities of complex diseases.

### Earth Sciences

I work with Project Matsu, a collaboration between NASA and the Open Cloud Consortium,
developing cloud-based applications for the analysis of Earth satellite imagery.
I am currently working on a Hadoop-based framework to automatically process daily
satellite images from NASA's Earth Observing-1 satellite.

### Astronomy

My astronomy research focused on deep observations of nearby galaxies, as described below. 

#### - Star formation in galaxy outskirts

The outer disk spiral arms of M81, caused by the interaction with M82 and NGC3077, are fertile grounds for exploring star formation in low density environments. The area is characterized by extended HI arms and filaments within which are found HII regions and dwarf galaxies, including Holmberg IX. Much attention has focused in past years on the evidence for star formation and on the properties of the stellar populations detected in these HI features, especially from recent GALEX and HST observations. I analyzed the HII region population over a 1.5 degree field, derived from a Burrell Schmidt H-alpha composite supplemented with ARC 3.5-m telescope emission line images of both inner and outer disk HII regions. I focused on studying the luminosities and morphologies of the HII regions and comparing the current massive star formation with the recent and past rates inferred from the stellar populations detected in the outer disk features. I also analyzed abundances for these star forming regions to help determine the origin of outer disk gas. Here you can find a link to my paper, finding a [shallow metallicity gradient for the HII regions of M81](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422..401P).

#### - Gas accretion

I am a member of the [HALOGAS](http://www.astron.nl/halogas/) collaboration. The Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) survey aims to investigate cold gas accretion in a sample of 22 neutrally-selected nearby spiral galaxies with 120 hours of integrated observation time at 21 cm for each target. The data are sensitive enough to study faint neutral hydrogen in the galaxy outskirts and to search for halogas and for possible accreting gas clouds. I am working on modeling the HI for a few of these galaxies and will be studying the correlation between features in the HI and features detected in GALEX UV.

#### - Faint stellar streams and low surface brightness features around galaxies
Deep and widefield optical imaging is essential to understand the role of accretion and the source of accreting gas and new material in galaxies. I have imaged the HALOGAS Survey sample of galaxies in broadband and emission line filters with the Kitt Peak National Observatory's 4-meter telescope, in order to search for faint companions and stellar stream features around the galaxies. We are comparing these images with our very deep HI data to better understand the process of galaxy growth.

#### - Neutral hydrogen in the local group
In the summer of 2008, I worked for 6 weeks at the Australia Telescope National Facility in Sydney, Australia with Dr. Robert Braun, studying and comparing opaque HI clumps in M31, M33, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. These regions of localized opaque gas are interesting since they are not always well correlated with CO detections (which trace molecular gas), and initial inspections show that those without CO counterparts may be representative of early evolution toward giant molecular cloud formation.

High column density opaque gas can be seen in clumps peppering the disk in the righthand image. (Image courtesy of Robert Braun.) </figcaption>
